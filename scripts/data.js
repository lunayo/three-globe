A century ago there were probably more than 230,000 orangutans in total, but the Bornean orangutan is now estimated at about 104 700 based on updated geographic range and the Sumatran about 7 500.

Their horns are used in traditional Chinese medicine and displayed as a symbol and demonstration of wealth. A Javan rhino horn can sell for up to USD$30 000 per kg on the black market. Because of poaching, three of the five species of rhinos are among the most endangered species in the world: the black rhino, the Javan rhino and the Sumatran rhino.

Destruction of their habitat because of global warming caused by holes in the ozone layer, oil and gas mining, and the reduction of seals available to eat in their habitat are some of the reasons they have become an endangered species. Polar bears will be wiped out by the end of the century unless more is done to tackle climate change, a study predicts. Polar bears are listed as vulnerable to extinction by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with climate change a key factor in their decline.', videoUrl: 'video/polarbear.mp4', color: '#ff0000' },

This number is now estimated to be less than 70. They are extremely vulnerable to poachers, who kill them for their coats and bones, the latter of which is sold for use in traditional Asian medicine. They are also at risk from habitat loss due to natural and man-made fires. Climate change is also leading to a decrease in prey availa-bility.', videoUrl: 'video/amurleopard.mp4', color: '#ff0000' },

Three out of four are Critically En-dangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The only one that is not is the Mountain Gorilla, a subspecies of the Eastern Gorilla, which is considered Endangered. There are only around 200-300 adult Cross River Gorillas left in the wild. Like many endangered animals, their decline is mostly due to poaching, habitat loss, disease and human con-flict. Gorillas are also slow to recover as they have a low reproductive rate, with females only giving birth every four to six years. One female will breed three or four times in her life-time.', videoUrl: 'video/gorilla.mp4', color: '#ff0000' },

Their biggest threat is from the illegal fishing of totoaba, a large fish in demand because of its swim blad-der. Vaquitas accidentally end up entangled in the gillnets set for toto-aba and drown because they can no longer swim to the surface to breathe. Conservation efforts led to the introduction of a ban on gillnets in vaquita habitat back in July 2016, but illegal fishing continues, and the threat remains. Efforts now focus on enforcing the ban on gillnets and per-secuting those that use them. Con-servationists are also working to de-crease demand for totoaba, which is a protected species.', videoUrl: 'video/vaquita.mp4', color: '#ff0000' },

Sunda tigers in particular are especially vulnerable. With numbers estimated to be at fewer than 400 today, accelerating deforestation and rampant poaching mean it could end up extinct like its Javan and Balinese counterparts.

Unfortunately, they are vulnerable to fishing; even though they are not directly targeted by fish-ermen, large numbers of the species die when they become accidentally entangled in fishing gear. The waters they live in are also constantly busy with fishermen and people using the waterways to move around, so they get injured and killed by boats and ships. Additionally, their waters are also affected by high levels of toxic pollutants. There are 1 040 finless porpoises left in the Yangtze. The annual decline rate of 13% means these animals are expected to be-come extinct within 10 years if there are no effective conservation actions in place.', videoUrl: 'video/porpoise.mp4', color: '#ff0000' },

They were once common throughout New Zealand and Polynesia but now inhabit just two small islands off the coast of southern New Zealand. One of the main threats to Kakapos is predation from introduced species such as cats and stoats that hunt using scent. It is effective against predators that rely on sight to hunt but not smell. Females also leave the nest unattended when finding food, leaving the eggs freely available to predators. Intensive conservation measures mean the population is on the increase now, which is positive. But, genetic diversity is low among the remaining kakapo, which could affect survival in the future, especially if they are struck by a disease.', videoUrl: 'video/kakapo.mp4', color: '#ff0000' },

Hunting is one of the biggest threats to sea turtles, with poachers target-ing their eggs, shells, meat and skin. They are also at risk from habitat loss, bycatch and pollution as well as climate change. Sand temperature determines the sex of hatchlings with eggs developing as females in warm-er temperatures. That means even small temperature changes could skew the sex ratio of populations.', videoUrl: 'video/seaturtle.mp4', color: '#ffa500' },

They have long thin snouts with a large bump on the end which resembles a pot known as a Ghara, which is where they get their name. They spend most of their time in freshwater rivers, only leaving the water to bask in the sun and lay eggs. Unfortunately, Gharial numbers have been in decline since the 1930s and, sadly, this large crocodilian is now close to extinction. There are only around 100 to 300 left in the wild. Their decline is due to several issues, though all human-made.
