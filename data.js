A century ago there were probably more than 230,000 orangutans in total, but the Bornean orangutan is now estimated at about 104 700 based on updated geographic range and the Sumatran about 7 500. They are primarily threatened by habitat loss from human-caused deforestation for palm oil.', videoUrl: 'resources/orangutan.mp4' },

Their horns are used in traditional Chinese medicine and displayed as a symbol and demonstration of wealth. A Javan rhino horn can sell for up to USD$30 000 per kg on the black market. Because of poaching, three of the five species of rhinos are among the most endangered species in the world: the black rhino, the Javan rhino and the Sumatran rhino. The Javan rhino is the closest to extinction with only between 46 to 66 individuals left, all of which are in Ujung Kulon National Park in Indonesia', videoUrl: 'resources/rhino.mp4' },
  { lat: 90.0, lng: 0.0, label: 'Polar bear', description: 'Polar bears live on the enormous amounts of ice over the Arctic Ocean. Destruction of their habitat because of global warming caused by holes in the ozone layer, oil and gas mining, and the reduction of seals available to eat in their habitat are some of the reasons they have become an endangered species. Polar bears will be wiped out by the end of the century unless more is done to tackle climate change, a study predicts. Polar bears are listed as vulnerable to extinction by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with climate change a key factor in their decline.', videoUrl: 'resources/polarbear.mp4' },
